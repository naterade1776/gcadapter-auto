Automatically set up your CLOUDREAM or official Gamecube USB adapter on linux. 

Give the script executable privileges (chmod), && run with sudo/doas/as root.
  It's going to throw a syntax error about an unterminated quoted string but I assume you can ignore it because I did and it works fine. 

UPDATE: Fixed a bunch of things. Script no longer throws any errors and only creates *one* config file.
